# Perceptron_simulation
Perceptron simulation (Neural building blocks) 

This is a simple implementation of a basic feedforward neural network in C. This example demonstrates a single-layer perceptron, where the network has an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. It uses sigmoid activation and gradient descent for learning.

**How It Works:**
1. **Forward Propagation:** The input values are processed using weights and a bias.
2. **Activation Function:** The sigmoid function transforms the weighted sum into the final output.
3. **Error Calculation:** We compute the difference between the predicted output and the target.
4. **Backpropagation & Learning:** The weights and biases are adjusted using gradient descent to minimize the error.
